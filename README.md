# jQuery Thumbslider
This is a responsive **jQuery Thumbslider** repository that contains a clean looking apple-like image slider.
The slider uses smaller thumbnail images for navigation, and slides can move both ways.

Different images are displayed using the picture element and srcset attribute based on the browser's screen size.

Also on this page are included Font Awesome icons to display social icons of LinkedIn, GitHub, and CodePen, which you can see when you click the Follow Me button located at the bottom of the page.

This project is done with semantic HTML5 markup, CSS styling, jQuery selectors, jQuery methods - addClass(), removeClass(), animate(), $.each loop, and JavaScript function to automatically switch slides that are set to 5 seconds using setInterval function.
